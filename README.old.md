# JS Frameworks - Module 1

## Lesson Task 1 Question

Create a new app using Create React App.

You can create an app inside the current folder using:

```
npx create-react-app .
```

Create two components, `ProfileName` and `DefaultProfilePic`.

ProfileName should receive one prop called `name` and return it inside an `<h4>` element.

DefaultProfilePic should import an image and return it using an `<img>` element. The component should also receive and use one prop, `altText`.

Place both these components in an appropriate folder.

Import and render both components in `src/App.js`, passing appropriate prop values in.

Styling is not important but you can place any styles in `src/App.css`, making sure you have that imported in `src/App.js`.

Example:

<img src="example.png" style="max-width: 350px">
